- **API Health**: Endpoints respond correctly to test requests

### **Limitations and Considerations:**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **AI Model Limitations**
- **Consistency Variance**: AI interpretation may vary between scenes
- **Style Matching**: Success depends on character photo quality and scene compatibility
- **Lighting Adaptation**: Complex scenes may challenge character integration
- **Pose/Angle Limitations**: Static reference photo limits character positioning options

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Considerations**
- **Processing Time**: 10-30 seconds per scene replacement
- **API Costs**: Each replacement consumes Gemini API quota
- **Memory Usage**: Base64 image processing requires significant memory
- **Rate Limiting**: Sequential processing prevents API throttling

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Quality Dependencies**
- **Reference Photo Quality**: High-resolution, well-lit photos work best
- **Scene Complexity**: Simple backgrounds easier than complex compositions
- **Character Pose**: Front-facing reference photos most versatile
- **Style Compatibility**: Character attire should match scene context
