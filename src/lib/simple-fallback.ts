I'm currently running on backup systems due to some technical issues with my main AI backend, but I can still provide great creative guidance.

Tell me about your brand:
â€¢ What industry are you in?
â€¢ Who's your target audience?
â€¢ What kind of ad are you looking to create?

Let's get started! ðŸŽ¬`;

**Brand Strategy:**
â€¢ Identifying your unique value proposition
â€¢ Understanding your target demographic
â€¢ Defining your brand voice and personality
â€¢ Positioning against competitors

**For a strong 30-second ad, I usually recommend:**
1. **Hook (0-5s):** Grab attention immediately
2. **Story (5-20s):** Show your product/service benefit
3. **Call-to-Action (20-30s):** Clear next step for viewers

**The Creative Brief Approach:**
â€¢ **Opening Hook:** What stops the scroll? (surprise, emotion, question)
â€¢ **Problem/Solution:** What pain point does your product solve?
â€¢ **Demonstration:** Show, don't just tell
â€¢ **Social Proof:** Quick testimonial or statistic
â€¢ **Clear CTA:** What action should viewers take?

**Production Tips:**
â€¢ Keep text minimal and readable
â€¢ Use high-quality visuals
â€¢ Match music to brand personality
â€¢ Test on mobile first (where most will watch)

What's your product/service? I can give you specific creative direction even while my main systems are offline.`;

2. **Emotional Hook:** Joy? Fear? Pride? What emotion drives action?
3. **Visual Storytelling:** Every frame should advance the story
4. **Memorable Moment:** What will they remember 24 hours later?

**Common Creative Strategies:**
â€¢ Before/After transformation
â€¢ Day-in-the-life scenarios
â€¢ Problem-solution narrative
â€¢ Aspirational lifestyle
â€¢ Behind-the-scenes authenticity

I may be running on backup systems, but 25+ years of creative experience doesn't need WiFi! What's your creative challenge?`;
