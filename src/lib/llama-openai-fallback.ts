Here's what I can tell you in the meantime:

For a 30-second coffee shop ad, I'd typically recommend:
- Hook (0-5s): Show the coffee ritual/moment of need
- Story (5-20s): Highlight what makes your coffee special 
- CTA (20-30s): Strong call to action with location/app

Would you like me to try again in a few minutes when the servers are back up? Or we can discuss your specific brand goals and I'll give you detailed creative direction once I'm fully operational.
