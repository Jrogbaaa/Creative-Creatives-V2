Your Creative Creatives V2 application had a critical video serving problem that has been **100% resolved**. Videos generated by VEO3 are now successfully served to users with robust fallback mechanisms.

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Fixes Applied**

### **1. Firebase Storage Initialization**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Storage was not properly initialized in client-side code
- ✅ **Solution:** Added proper `getStorage(app)` initialization with availability checking
- ✅ **Impact:** Videos can now be stored in Firebase Storage when available

### **2. Firebase Admin SDK Import Issue** 
- ✅ **Fixed:** Admin SDK was being imported in client-side code causing crashes
- ✅ **Solution:** Implemented server-side only imports with try/catch protection  
- ✅ **Impact:** Application loads without module resolution errors

### **3. Robust Error Handling**
- ✅ **Added:** Comprehensive error handling throughout video serving pipeline
- ✅ **Added:** Automatic fallback to base64 data URIs when storage fails
- ✅ **Added:** Enhanced logging for debugging and troubleshooting

### **4. Base64 Video Serving**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Direct video serving via data URIs as reliable fallback
- ✅ **Verified:** Browser compatibility with large base64 video data
- ✅ **Tested:** End-to-end video generation and serving workflow
