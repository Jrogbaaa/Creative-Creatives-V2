# Character Replacement & Consistency System Guide üë•‚ú®

## Overview

The Character Replacement & Consistency System is a revolutionary feature that allows you to upload photos of real people and seamlessly integrate them into your advertisement storyboards. This system provides both individual scene replacement and batch processing for consistent character application across multiple scenes.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Human Character Upload & Management
- **Upload Real People**: Add photos of anyone you want to feature in your ads
- **Character Library**: Organize and manage your character collection
- **Naming System**: Give meaningful names to characters (e.g., "CEO John", "Model Sarah")
- **Descriptions**: Add optional descriptions for better AI integration
- **Reusable Assets**: Use the same characters across multiple projects

### 2. AI-Powered Character Replacement
- **Smart Integration**: AI seamlessly replaces people in scenes with your characters
- **Style Preservation**: Maintains original lighting, mood, and composition
- **Natural Placement**: Characters appear naturally integrated into the scene
- **Context Awareness**: Replacement considers scene context and character description

### 3. Batch Processing & Consistency
- **Apply to All Scenes**: One-click application across entire storyboard
- **Character Consistency**: Ensure the same person appears throughout your ad
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates during batch processing
- **Selective Application**: Choose which scenes to apply characters to

## üöß Development Mode Features

**Test everything without API keys!**

The system includes comprehensive development mode functionality:

- **Mock Character Replacement**: Placeholder responses for testing

## üé® User Experience Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Character Upload
```
1. Navigate to the Create Ad page
2. Upload character photos using the upload interface
3. Name your characters (e.g., "CEO", "Brand Ambassador")
4. Add optional descriptions for better AI integration
5. Characters are saved in your character library
```

#### 2. Storyboard Generation
```
1. Generate your storyboard using Marcus AI
2. Marcus creates professional scenes based on your brand
3. Each scene gets 2-3 image options from Nano Banana
4. Select the best image for each scene
```

#### 3. Character Application

**Individual Scene Replacement:**
```
1. Click on any scene in your storyboard
2. Use Quick Apply buttons for one-click replacement
3. Or use the detailed replacement interface for custom prompts
4. See replaced images with your character integrated
```

**Batch Character Application:**
```
1. Use the Character Consistency Manager
2. Select which character to apply
3. Choose scenes to apply to (or select all)
4. Start batch processing
5. Track progress in real-time
6. Review all replaced scenes together
```

#### 4. Video Generation
```
1. Generate video using your character-replaced scenes
2. VEO 3 creates videos with your chosen characters
3. Characters appear consistently throughout the ad
4. Professional talking characters with synchronized audio
```

## üîç Advanced Features

### Style Preservation
The character replacement system maintains:
- **Original Lighting**: Preserves scene lighting and shadows
- **Composition**: Maintains camera angles and framing
- **Color Grading**: Keeps consistent color palette
- **Mood & Atmosphere**: Preserves the scene's emotional tone

### Smart Character Integration
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands scene context for natural placement
- **Size & Scale**: Characters appear at appropriate sizes for the scene
- **Perspective Matching**: Characters match the scene's perspective
- **Clothing Adaptation**: Characters may adapt clothing to scene context

### Batch Processing Intelligence
- **Scene Analysis**: AI analyzes each scene for optimal character placement
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensures character appears consistently across scenes
- **Quality Control**: Validates replacement quality before finalizing
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically retries failed replacements

## üéØ Best Practices

### Character Upload Guidelines
1. **High Quality Photos**: Use clear, well-lit photos (recommended: 512x512px minimum)
2. **Frontal Views**: Face-forward photos work best for replacement
3. **Consistent Lighting**: Avoid photos with extreme shadows
4. **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful names like "CEO John" instead of generic names
5. **Professional Images**: Use professional headshots for business advertisements

### Replacement Prompt Tips
1. **Be Specific**: "Replace the business person at the desk" vs "replace the person"
2. **Provide Context**: Include scene context in your prompts
3. **Character Description**: Describe your character's role or profession
4. **Style Guidance**: Mention if you want to preserve specific styling

### Batch Processing Strategy
1. **Test Individual Scenes First**: Try single replacements before batch processing
2. **Review Scene Selection**: Ensure all selected scenes are suitable for replacement
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch batch processing for any errors
4. **Quality Check**: Review all results before proceeding to video generation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Character Upload Issues
```
Problem: Image upload fails
Solution: 
- Check image format (JPEG, PNG supported)
- Ensure image size is reasonable (< 10MB)
- Verify stable internet connection
```

#### Replacement Quality Issues
```
Problem: Character doesn't look natural in scene
Solution:
- Try more specific replacement prompts
- Use higher quality character photos
- Describe the character's role in the scene
```

#### Batch Processing Failures
```
Problem: Some scenes fail during batch processing
Solution:
- Check individual scenes first
- Retry failed scenes individually
- Review scene compatibility with character
```

### Development Mode Indicators
When using mock services, you'll see:
- **Mock labels**: "Development Mode" indicators
- **Setup instructions**: Links to API configuration guides
- **Placeholder results**: Sample replaced images for testing

### API Key Issues
```
Problem: "GEMINI_API_KEY not configured" error
Solution:
1. Get API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Add GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key to .env.local
3. Restart development server
```

## üìä Performance & Limitations
