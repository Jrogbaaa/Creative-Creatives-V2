4. ❌ **Gallery couldn't display videos that were no longer in memory**

### **The Evidence**
Our testing revealed:
- ✅ VEO3 API calls are successful and return valid video data
- ✅ Job IDs are properly generated and tracked
- ✅ Video status checking works correctly
- ✅ Complete MP4 video data is returned

### **The Resolution**
- ✅ Fixed the storage pipeline to properly handle videos
- ✅ Videos now persist and are accessible via API
- ✅ Gallery infrastructure ready for video display
- ✅ No more money wasted - every generation will be preserved
